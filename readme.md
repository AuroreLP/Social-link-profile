## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Media queries

### What I learned

- it's very important to spend time on the figma file to analyse and understand all the subtleties of the design.
- I built the card step by step, starting by the biggest elements and finishing with the details
- to make it responsive, i used the media queries. The foundation of the code is based on the mobile version, then i made the changes to be responsive for the tablet and desktop versions

### Continued development

I would like to find a way to make my code more efficient, with less lines, especially for padding, margin, and typography. Will learn more about the 'clamp' solution.
